## Weather-Widget

Mini project which shows weather forecast and local time for any city the user wants to

### Description

Project from a practical exam for Telacad Academy to prove my course completion.

### Functionality
The user can search for any city he wants and display few information about it (weather forecast, local date-time). The inital requirments were only reffering at the functionality of a local time clock, but I wanted to make something more than just a digital clockwatch so I developed a mini weather widget available for any city on the globe, by taking information from https://api.openweathermap.org.
